<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Action</h3>
<p>A behavior the AI can choose to perform. Contains considerations for scoring and an executor for implementation.</p>

<h3>Archetype</h3>
<p>Pre-configured AI template providing foundational behaviors (BaseCombat, BaseStealth, etc.).</p>

<h3>Base Score</h3>
<p>Starting score value for an action before considerations are applied (typically 30-90).</p>

<h3>Brain</h3>
<p>The UUtilityBrainComponent that manages action evaluation and execution.</p>

<h3>Consideration</h3>
<p>A single factor in action scoring. Maps an input value through a response curve to affect final score.</p>

<h3>Executor</h3>
<p>Component that implements action behavior (Behavior Tree, Blueprint, or custom C++).</p>

<h3>Input Provider</h3>
<p>Component that publishes data to Named Inputs for use in action scoring.</p>

<h3>Momentum</h3>
<p>Penalty applied to recently-executed actions to prevent repetitive behavior.</p>

<h3>Named Input</h3>
<p>Key-value pair (FName â†’ float) representing world state, published by services.</p>

<h3>Preset</h3>
<p>Configuration asset containing actions, services, and settings for an AI type.</p>

<h3>Priority</h3>
<p>Tie-breaker value when actions have equal scores (0-100).</p>

<h3>Replace Resistance</h3>
<p>Multiplier requiring new action to score higher to interrupt current action (reduces thrashing).</p>

<h3>Response Curve</h3>
<p>Curve mapping input value (0-1) to score contribution (0-100) in a consideration.</p>

<h3>Service</h3>
<p>Component that runs periodically to gather data and publish Named Inputs.</p>

<h3>Squad</h3>
<p>Group of AI agents coordinating via TacticalSquadComponent and related services.</p>

<h3>Utility AI</h3>
<p>AI architecture using score-based decision making instead of priority or rule-based systems.</p>

<h2>Advanced Terms</h2>

<h3>Task Locking</h3>
<p>Preventing an action from being selected for a duration after failure or abortion.</p>

<h3>Score Modifier</h3>
<p>Runtime multiplier applied to action score for dynamic behavior adjustment.</p>

<h3>Stimulus Memory</h3>
<p>Remembered perceptions (enemy last-known positions) maintained by PerceptionMonitor service.</p>

<h3>Threat Level</h3>
<p>Calculated danger assessment (0-1) based on enemy distance, count, and visibility.</p>

<h3>Tactical Strategy</h3>
<p>Squad-level decision (Search/Assault/Flank/Hold/Retreat) synthesized by leader.</p>
